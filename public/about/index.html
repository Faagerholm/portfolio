    <p>Hello there,<br>
I am a computer engineering student, soon to graduate, with a background in electronics. With multiple years of full-stack Java, and Python development experience.</p>
<p>I have worked with both large projects and small POC projects, usually in an agile environment with both SAFe and scrum. Team management is one of my strong suits from working with the student association board for multiple years.</p>
<p>I have an interest in machine learning and in particular Reinforcement learning. I wrote my bachelor’s thesis about machine learning in a board game environment. I am currently working on my Master&rsquo;s thesis with an subject in deep learning, building a LSTM model to predict blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>Always up for the challenge and eager to learn new skills!</p>
<p>Read more about my knowledge and IT skills <a href="/posts/technologies">here</a></p>
<h3 id="other-things-about-me">Other things about me</h3>
<p>Sports take up most of my free time, in particular Crossfit. But also disc golf, swimming, and hiking. When there is time over or I am having a rest day I like to tinker with electronics or learn a new craft. Fine dining at home is also sort of a hobby for me. Over the last few years, I have developed a huge interest in fermentation, everything from beer to kimchi and beyond. In the future the blog might get some food and fermentation content.</p>
