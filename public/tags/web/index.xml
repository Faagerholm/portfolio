      <description>These are the technologies I master. Some of these I have not touched in the last year. I first touched C and C++ back in 2014. It was my main language until 2016, then I started learning Java and Python through the University. I have later used C# in a few projects, in both website heavy projects and an embedded project. In the recent years I have mainly done Web development with Javascript, React, Vue and Angular.</description>
